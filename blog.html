                <p>1. difference between local storage and session storage in javascript ?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Answer: sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage
                doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is
                loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that
                particular tab.</p>

                <p>2. difference between global scope and block scope in javascript ?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Answer: In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js,
                it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for
                statements, and the like</p>
            <h6>Global Scope</h6>
            <p>Variables defined outside any function, block, or module scope have global scope. Variables in global
                scope can be accessed from everywhere in the application.</p>
            <h6>Block Scope</h6>
            <p>Block scope is defined with curly braces. It is separated by { and }.
                Variables declared with let and const can have block scope. They can only be accessed in the block in
                which they are defined.</p>

                <p>3. how javascript event loop works ?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Answer: The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                Stack
                is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
                which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
